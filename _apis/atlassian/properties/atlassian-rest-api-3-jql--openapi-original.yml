        This operation can filter the custom fields returned by project. Invalid
        project IDs in `projectIds` are ignored. System fields are always
        returned.


        It can also return the collapsed field for custom fields. Collapsed
        fields enable searches to be performed across all fields with the same
        name and of the same field type. For example, the collapsed field
        `Component - Component[Dropdown]` enables dropdown fields `Component -
        cf[10061]` and `Component - cf[10062]` to be searched simultaneously.

        Sanitizes one or more JQL queries by converting readable details into
        IDs where a user doesn't have permission to view the entity.


        For example, if the query contains the clause *project = 'Secret
        project'*, and a user does not have browse permission for the project
        "Secret project", the sanitized query replaces the clause with *project
        = 12345"* (where 12345 is the ID of the project). If a user has the
        required permission, the clause is not sanitized. If the account ID is
        null, sanitizing is performed for an anonymous user.


        Note that sanitization doesn't make the queries GDPR-compliant, because
        it doesn't remove user identifiers (username or user key). If you need
        to make queries GDPR-compliant, use [Convert user identifiers to account
        IDs in JQL
        queries](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-jql/#api-rest-api-3-jql-sanitize-post).


        Before sanitization each JQL query is parsed. The queries are returned
        in the same order that they were passed.

        The Jira REST API enables you to interact with Jira programmatically.
        Use this API to 

        [build
        apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/integrating-with-jira-cloud/),
        script interactions with 

        Jira, or develop any other type of integration. This page documents the
        REST resources available in Jira Cloud, including 

        the HTTP response codes and example requests and responses.
      title: About
    - anchor: version
      body: >
        This documentation is for **version 3** of the Jira Cloud platform REST
        API, which is the latest version

        but is in **beta**. [Version
        2](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/) and 

        version 3 of the API offer the same collection of operations. However,
        version 3 provides support for 

        the [Atlassian Document
        Format](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/apis/document/structure/) 

        (ADF) in: 

        - `body` in comments, including where comments are used in issue, issue
        link, and transition resources.

        - `comment` in worklogs.

        - `description` and `environment` fields in issues.

        - `textarea` type custom fields (multi-line text fields) in issues.
        Single line custom fields 
          (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.

        However, these new features are under development and may change.

    - anchor: authentication
      body: >
        ### Forge apps


        For Forge apps, [REST API
        scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/scopes-for-oauth-2-3LO-and-forge-apps/) 

        are used when authenticating with Jira Cloud platform. See [Add scopes
        to call an Atlassian REST
        API](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/add-scopes-to-call-an-atlassian-rest-api/)
        for more details.


        The URIs for Forge app REST API calls have this structure:


        `/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


        For example, `/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`


        ### Connect apps


        For Connect apps, authentication (JWT-based) is built into the Connect
        libraries. Authorization is implemented using either 

        scopes (shown as _App scope required_ for operations on this page) or
        user impersonation. See 

        [Security for Connect
        apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/) 

        for details.


        The URIs for Connect app REST API calls have this structure:


        `https://<site-url>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


        For example, `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`


        ### Other integrations


        For integrations that are not Forge or Connect apps, use OAuth 2.0
        authorization code grants (3LO) for security 

        (3LO scopes are shown as for operations _OAuth scopes required_). See 

        [OAuth 2.0 (3LO)
        apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/) 

        for details.


        The URIs for OAuth 2.0 (3LO) app REST API calls have this structure:


        `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


        For example,
        `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/35273b54-3f06-40d2-880f-dd28cf8daafa/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`


        ### Ad-hoc API calls


        For personal scripts, bots, and ad-hoc execution of the REST APIs use
        basic authentication. See [Basic auth for REST
        APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/)
        for details. 


        The URIs for basic authentication REST API calls have this structure:


        `https://<site-url>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


        For example, `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`
      title: Authentication and authorization
    - anchor: permissions
      body: >
        ### Operation permissions


        Most operations in this API require permissions. The calling user must
        have the required permissions for an operation to 

        use it. Note that for Connect apps, the app user must have the required
        permissions for the operation and the app must 

        have scopes that permit the operation.


        A permission can be granted to a group, project role, or issue role that
        the user is a member of, or granted directly to a user. 

        See [Permissions overview](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ)
        for details. The most common permissions are:


        - **Administer the Cloud site**: Users in the _site-admins_ group have
        this 

        permission. See [Manage
        groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) for details.

        - **Administer Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Administrators_ global
        permission. There is a default group for this permission. 

        See [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) and
        [Managing global permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg)
        for details.

        - **Administer a project in Jira**: Granted by the _Administer projects_
        project permission for a project. This can be 

        granted to a user, a group, a project role, and more. 

        See [Managing project
        permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for details.

        - **Access a project in Jira**: Granted by the _Browse projects_ project
        permission for a project. This can be 

        granted to a user, a group, a project role, and more. 

        See [Managing project
        permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for details.

        - **Access Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Users_ global permission. Users
        in the default product access group (for example, 

        _jira-software-users-acmesite_) have this permission. 

        See [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) and 

        [Managing global permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg)
        for details.


        ### Anonymous access


        Some operations provide support for anonymous access. However, anonymous
        access is only available if 

        the Jira permission needed to access the object or records returned by
        the operation is granted to 

        the _Public_ group. See [Allowing anonymous access to your
        project](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/GDxxLg) 

        for details.


        If an operation is called anonymously and anonymous access is not
        available, the operation will return 

        an error. Note that not all operations that correspond to objects that
        can be given public access 

        provide for anonymous access.
      title: Permissions
    - anchor: expansion
      body: >+
        ### Expansion


        The Jira REST API uses resource expansion, which means that some parts
        of a resource are not returned unless specified 

        in the request. This simplifies responses and minimizes network traffic.


        To expand part of a resource in a request, use the expand query
        parameter and specify the object(s) to be expanded. 

        If you need to expand nested objects, use the `.` dot notation. If you
        need to expand multiple objects, use a 

        comma-separated list. 


        For example, the following request expands the `names` and
        `renderedFields` properties for the _JRACLOUD-34423_ issue:


        `GET issue/JRACLOUD-34423?expand=names,renderedFields`


        To discover which object can be expanded, refer to the `expand` property
        in the object. 

        In the JSON example below, the resource declares `widgets` as
        expandable.


        ```json

        {
          "expand": "widgets", 
          "self": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/resource/KEY-1", 
          "widgets": {
            "widgets": [],
            "size": 5
           }
        }

        ```


        ### Pagination


        The Jira REST API uses pagination to improve performance. Pagination is
        enforced for operations that could return a large 

        collection of items. When you make a request to a paginated resource,
        the response wraps the returned array of values in 

        a JSON object with paging metadata. For example:


        ```json

        {
            "startAt" : 0,
            "maxResults" : 10,
            "total": 200,
            "isLast": false,
            "values": [
                { /* result 0 */ },
                { /* result 1 */ },
                { /* result 2 */ }
            ]
        }

        ```


        *   `startAt` is the index of the first item returned in the page.

        *   `maxResults` is the maximum number of items that a page can return.
        Each operation can have a different limit for
            the number of items returned, and these limits may change without notice. To find the maximum number of items 
            that an operation could return, set `maxResults` to a large number—for example, over 1000—and if the returned value of `maxResults` is less than the requested value, the returned value is the maximum.
        *    `total` is the total number of items contained in all pages. This
        number **_may change_** as the client 

        requests the subsequent pages, therefore the client should always assume
        that the requested page can be empty. Note 

        that this property is not returned for all operations.

        *   `isLast` indicates whether the page returned is the last one. Note
        that this property is not returned for all operations.


        ### Ordering


        Some operations support ordering the elements of a response by a field.
        Check the documentation for the operation to 

        confirm whether ordering of a response is supported and which fields can
        be used. Responses are listed in ascending order 

        by default. You can change the order using the `orderby` query parameter
        with a `-` or `+` symbol. For example:


        *   `?orderBy=name` to order by `name` field ascending.

        *   `?orderBy=+name` to order by `name` field ascending.

        *   `?orderBy=-name` to order by `name` field descending.


      title: Expansion, pagination, and ordering
    - anchor: timestamps
      body: >
        By default, top-level timestamps (e.g. updated and created) are returned
        in [ISO 8601](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) format, in the system
        default user time zone.


        To return date time data in the logged in user's timezone, please refer
        to `renderedFields` property under the `expand` query parameter in
        relevant APIs.
      title: Timestamps
    - anchor: special-request-headers
      body: >-
        The following request and response headers define important metadata for
        the Jira Cloud REST API resources.


        -   `X-Atlassian-Token` (request): Operations that accept
        multipart/form-data must include the `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check`

        header in requests. Otherwise the request is blocked by cross-site
        request forgery (CSRF/XSRF) protection.

        -   `X-Force-Accept-Language` (request): controls how the standard HTTP
        `Accept-Language` header is processed.

        By default `Accept-Language` is ignored and the response is in the
        language configured in the user's profile or,

        when no language is configured for the user, the default Jira instance
        language. For the response to recognize

        `Accept-Language` send `X-Force-Accept-Language = true` as well. If
        `Accept-Language` requests a language that Jira

        can return the response is in that language, otherwise Jira returns the
        response in the default language. If

        `Accept-Language` is not specified the response is in the default
        language.

        -   `X-AAccountId` (response): This response header contains the
        Atlassian account ID of the authenticated user.
      title: Special headers
    - anchor: anonymous-operations
      body: |2-
         Jira provides for all permissions, except the [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) Administer Jira, to be assigned to *Anyone*. Once a permission is assigned to *Anyone*, anyone knowing a project's URL is able to use the features in Jira enabled by the permission. However, the Jira REST API does not enable anonymous access for operations by default. This means that an anonymous user who may be able to perform an action through Jira, may not be able to perform the same action where it's enabled by the REST API. 

         The operations that provide anonymous access are annotated "This operation can be accessed anonymously."
      title: Anonymous operations
    - anchor: async-operations
      body: >-
        Some Jira REST API operations may trigger long-running or
        computationally expensive tasks. In these cases, the operation 

        will schedule an asynchronous task and return a `303 (See Other)`
        response, indicating the location of the queued task 

        in the `Location` header. You can query this task to get progress
        updates.


        When the task finishes, the response object will contain the `result`
        field. The content of the field is specific to the 

        operation that created the task. Refer to the operation’s documentation
        for more information.


        Note that asynchronous tasks are not guaranteed to be run in order. In
        other words, if you need your tasks to execute 

        in a certain order, you should start a task only after the prerequisite
        task(s) have finished.
      title: Asynchronous operations

        Features and methods marked as experimental may change without notice.
        Feedback on experimental functionality is welcome.

      title: Experimental features
    - anchor: status-codes
      body: >-
        The Jira Cloud platform REST API uses the [standard HTTP status
        codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).


        Operations that return an error status code may also return a response
        body containing details of the error or errors. 

        The schema for the response body is shown below:
