        Creates a new webhook on the specified workspace.


        Workspace webhooks are fired for events from all repositories contained

        by that workspace.


        Example:


        ```

        $ curl -X POST -u credentials -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
          https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/workspaces/my-workspace/hooks
          -d '
            {
              "description": "Webhook Description",
              "url": "https://example.com/",
              "active": true,
              "secret": "this is a really bad secret",
              "events": [
                "repo:push",
                "issue:created",
                "issue:updated"
              ]
            }'
        ```


        When the `secret` is provided it will be used as the key to generate a
        HMAC

        digest value sent in the `X-Hub-Signature` header at delivery time.
        Passing

        a `null` or empty `secret` or not passing a `secret` will leave the
        webhook's

        secret unset. Bitbucket only generates the `X-Hub-Signature` when the
        webhook's

        secret is set.


        This call requires the webhook scope, as well as any scope

        that applies to the events that the webhook subscribes to. In the

        example above that means: `webhook`, `repository` and `issue`.


        The `url` must properly resolve and cannot be an internal, non-routed
        address.


        Only workspace owners can install webhooks on workspaces.

        The following properties can be mutated:


        * `description`

        * `url`

        * `secret`

        * `active`

        * `events`


        The hook's secret is used as a key to generate the HMAC hex digest sent
        in the

        `X-Hub-Signature` header at delivery time. This signature is only
        generated

        when the hook has a secret.


        Set the hook's secret by passing the new value in the `secret` field.
        Passing a

        `null` value in the `secret` field will remove the secret from the hook.
        The

        hook's secret can be left unchanged by not passing the `secret` field in
        the

        request.

        Permissions can be:


        * `admin`

        * `write`

        * `read`


        Results may be further [filtered or
        sorted](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#filtering)

        by repository, user, or permission by adding the following query string

        parameters:


        * `q=repository.name="geordi"` or `q=permission>"read"`

        * `sort=user.display_name`


        Note that the query parameter values need to be URL escaped so that `=`

        would become `%3D`.

        You cannot delete a project that still contains repositories.

        To delete the project,
        [delete](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-repositories/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-delete)

        or transfer the repositories first.


        Example:

        ```

        $ curl -X DELETE

        Since this endpoint can be used to both update and to create a
        project, the request body depends on the intent.

        #### Creation

        See the POST documentation for the project collection for an
        example of the request body.

        Note: The `key` should not be specified in the body of request
        (since it is already present in the URL). The `name` is required,
        everything else is optional.

        #### Update

        See the POST documentation for the project collection for an
        example of the request body.

        Note: The key is not required in the body (since it is already in
        the URL). The key may be specified in the body, if the intent is
        to change the key itself. In such a scenario, the location of the
        project is changed and is returned in the `Location` header of the
        response.

        Update the branching model configuration for a project.


        The `development` branch can be configured to a specific branch or to

        track the main branch. Any branch name can be supplied, but will only

        successfully be applied to a repository via inheritance if that branch

        exists for that repository. Only the passed properties will be updated.
        The

        properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a

        `development` property will leave the development branch unchanged.


        The `production` branch can be a specific branch, the main

        branch or disabled. Any branch name can be supplied, but will only

        successfully be applied to a repository via inheritance if that branch

        exists for that repository. The `enabled` property can be used to enable
        (`true`)

        or disable (`false`) it. Only the passed properties will be updated. The

        properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a

        `production` property will leave the production branch unchanged.


        The `branch_types` property contains the branch types to be updated.

        Only the branch types passed will be updated. All updates will be

        rejected if it would leave the branching model in an invalid state.

        For branch types this means that:


        1. The prefixes for all enabled branch types are valid. For example,
           it is not possible to use '*' inside a Git prefix.
        2. A prefix of an enabled branch type must not be a prefix of another
           enabled branch type. This is to ensure that a branch can be easily
           classified by its prefix unambiguously.

        It is possible to store an invalid prefix if that branch type would be

        left disabled. Only the passed properties will be updated. The

        properties not passed will be left unchanged. Each branch type must

        have a `kind` property to identify it.

        Only users with admin permission for the project may access this
        resource.


        Due to security concerns, the JWT and OAuth authentication methods are
        unsupported.

        This is to ensure integrations and add-ons are not allowed to change
        permissions.


        Permissions can be:


        * `admin`

        * `create-repo`

        * `write`

        * `read`

        Search for code in the repositories of the specified workspace.

        Note that searches can match in the file's text (`content_matches`),
        the path (`path_matches`), or both.

        You can use the same syntax for the search query as in the UI.
        E.g. to search for "foo" only within the repository "demo",
        use the query parameter `search_query=foo+repo:demo`.

        Similar to other APIs, you can request more fields using a
        `fields` query parameter. E.g. to get some more information about
        the repository of matched files, use the query parameter
        `search_query=foo&fields=%2Bvalues.file.commit.repository`
        (the `%2B` is a URL-encoded `+`).

        Try `fields=%2Bvalues.*.*.*.*` to get an idea what's possible.

        ### Basic auth


        Basic HTTP Authentication as per
        [RFC-2617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) (Digest not supported).

        Note that Basic Auth is available only with username and [app
        password](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/) as
        credentials.


        ### Access Tokens


        Access Tokens are passwords (or tokens) that provide access to a
        _single_ repository, project or workspace.

        These tokens can authenticate with Bitbucket APIs for scripting, CI/CD
        tools, Bitbucket Cloud-connected apps,

        and Bitbucket Cloud integrations.


        Access Tokens are linked to a repository, project, or workspace, not a
        user account.

        The level of access provided by the token is set when a repository, or
        workspace admin creates it,

        by setting permission scopes.


        There are three types of Access Token:


        * **Repository Access Tokens** can connect to a single repository,
        preventing them from accessing any other repositories or workspaces.

        * **Project Access Tokens** can connect to a single project, providing
        access to any repositories within the project.

        * **Workspace Access Tokens** can connect to a single workspace and have
        access to any projects and repositories within that workspace.


        When using Bitbucket APIs with an Access Token, the token will be
        treated as the "user" in the

        Bitbucket UI and Bitbucket logs. This includes when using the Access
        Token to leave a comment on a pull request,

        push a commit, or merge a pull request. The Bitbucket UI and API
        responses will show the

        Repository/Project/Workspace Access Token as a user. The username shown
        in the Bitbucket UI is the Access

        Token _name_, and a custom icon is used to differentiate it from a
        regular user in the UI.


        #### Considerations for using Access Tokens


        * After creation, an Access Token can't be viewed or modified. The
        token's name, created date,

        last accessed date, and scopes are visible on the repository, project,
        or workspace **Access Tokens** page.

        * Access Tokens can access a limited set of Bitbucket's permission
        scopes.

        * Provided you set the correct permission scopes, you can use an Access
        Token to clone (`repository`)

        and push (`repository:write`) code to the token's repository or the
        repositories the token can access.

        * You can't use an Access Token to log into the Bitbucket website.

        * Access Tokens don't require two-step verification.

        * You can set permission scopes (specific access rights) for each Access
        Token.

        * You can't use an Access Token to manipulate or query repository,
        project, or workspace permissions.

        * Access Tokens are not listed in any repository or workspace permission
        API response.

        * Access Tokens are deactivated when deleting the resource tied to it (a
        repository, project, or workspace).

        Repository Access Tokens are also revoked when transferring the
        repository to another workspace.

        * Any content created by the Access Token will persist after the Access
        Token has been revoked.

        * Access Tokens can interact with branch restriction APIs, but the token
        can't be configured as a user with merge access when using branch
        restrictions.


        There are some APIs which are inaccessible for Access Tokens, these are:


        * [Add a repository deploy
        key](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-deployments/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-deploy-keys-post)

        * [Update a repository deploy
        key](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-deployments/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-deploy-keys-key-id-put)

        * [Delete a repository deploy
        key](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-deployments/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-deploy-keys-key-id-delete)

        ### App passwords


        App passwords allow users to make API calls to their Bitbucket account
        through apps such as Sourcetree.


        Some important points about app passwords:


        * You cannot view an app password or adjust permissions after you create
        the app password. Because app passwords are encrypted on our database
        and cannot be viewed by anyone. They are essentially designed to be
        disposable. If you need to change the scopes or lost the password just
        create a new one.

        * You cannot use them to log into your Bitbucket account.

        * You cannot use app passwords to manage team actions.

            App passwords are tied to an individual account's credentials and should not be shared. If you're sharing your app password you're essentially giving direct, authenticated, access to everything that password has been scoped to do with the Bitbucket API's.

        * You can use them for API call authentication, even if you don't have
        two-step verification enabled.

        * You can set permission scopes (specific access rights) for each app
        password.


        For details on creating, managing, and using App passwords, visit

        [App
        passwords](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/).


        ### OAuth 2.0


        Our OAuth 2 implementation is merged in with our existing OAuth 1 in

        such a way that existing OAuth 1 consumers automatically become

        valid OAuth 2 clients. The only thing you need to do is edit your

        existing consumer and configure a callback URL.


        Once that is in place, you'll have the following 2 URLs:

            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize
            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token

        For obtaining access/bearer tokens, we support three of RFC-6749's grant

        flows, plus a custom Bitbucket flow for exchanging JWT tokens for access
        tokens.

        Note that Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (4.3) is no longer
        supported.



        #### 1. Authorization Code Grant (4.1)


        The full-blown 3-LO flow. Request authorization from the end user by

        sending their browser to:

            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=code

        The callback includes the `?code={}` query parameter that you can swap

        for an access token:

            $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
              https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
              -d grant_type=authorization_code -d code={code}


        #### 2. Implicit Grant (4.2)


        This flow is useful for browser-based add-ons that operate without
        server-side backends.


        Request the end user for authorization by directing the browser to:

            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=token

        That will redirect to your preconfigured callback URL with a fragment

        containing the access token

        (`#access_token={token}&token_type=bearer`) where your page's js can

        pull it out of the URL.



        #### 3. Client Credentials Grant (4.4)


        Somewhat like our existing "2-LO" flow for OAuth 1. Obtain an access

        token that represents not an end user, but the owner of the

        client/consumer:

            $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
              https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
              -d grant_type=client_credentials


        #### 4. Bitbucket Cloud JWT Grant (urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt)


        If your Atlassian Connect add-on uses JWT authentication, you can swap a

        JWT for an OAuth access token. The resulting access token represents the

        account for which the add-on is installed.


        Make sure you send the JWT token in the Authorization request header

        using the "JWT" scheme (case sensitive). Note that this custom scheme

        makes this different from HTTP Basic Auth (and so you cannot use "curl

        -u").

            $ curl -X POST -H "Authorization: JWT {jwt_token}" \
              https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
              -d grant_type=urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt


        #### Making Requests


        Once you have an access token, as per RFC-6750, you can use it in a
        request in any of

        the following ways (in decreasing order of desirability):


        1. Send it in a request header: `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`

        2. Include it in a (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) POST body as
        `access_token={access_token}`

        3. Put it in the query string of a non-POST:
        `?access_token={access_token}`



        #### Repository Cloning


        Since add-ons will not be able to upload their own SSH keys to clone

        with, access tokens can be used as Basic HTTP Auth credentials to

        clone securely over HTTPS. This is much like GitHub, yet slightly

        different:

            $ git clone https://x-token-auth:{access_token}@bitbucket.org/user/repo.git

        The literal string `x-token-auth` as a substitute for username is

        required (note the difference with GitHub where the actual token is in

        the username field).



        #### Refresh Tokens


        Our access tokens expire in one hour. When this happens you'll get 401

        responses.


        Most access tokens grant responses (Implicit and JWT excluded).
        Therefore, you should include a

        refresh token that can then be used to generate a new access token,

        without the need for end user participation:

            $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
              https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
              -d grant_type=refresh_token -d refresh_token={refresh_token}


        ### Bitbucket OAuth 2.0 scopes


        Bitbucket's API applies a number of privilege scopes to endpoints. In
        order to access an endpoint, a request will need to have the necessary
        scopes.


        OAuth 2.0 Scopes are applicable for OAuth 2, Access Tokens, and App
        passwords auth mechanisms as well as Bitbucket Connect apps.


        Scopes are declared in the descriptor as a list of strings, with each
        string being the name of a unique scope.


        A descriptor lacking the `scopes` element is implicitly assumed to
        require all scopes and as a result, Bitbucket will require end users
        authorizing/installing the add-on

        to explicitly accept all scopes.


        Our best practice suggests you add only the scopes your add-on needs,
        but no more than it needs.


        Invalid scope strings will cause the descriptor to be rejected and the
        installation to fail.


        The available scopes are:


        - [project](#project)

        - [project:write](#project-write)

        - [project:admin](#project-admin)

        - [repository](#repository)

        - [pipeline:variable](#pipeline-variable)

        - [runner](#runner)

        - [runner:write](#runner-write)


        #### project


        Provides access to view the project or projects.

        This scope implies the [`repository`](#repository) scope, giving read
        access to all the repositories in a project or projects.


        #### project:write


        This scope is deprecated, and has been made obsolete by `project:admin`.
        Please see the deprecation notice
        [here](/cloud/bitbucket/deprecation-notice-project-write-scope).


        #### project:admin


        Provides admin access to a project or projects. No distinction is made
        between public and private projects. This scope doesn't implicitly grant
        the [`project`](#project) scope or the
        [`repository:write`](#repository-write) scope on any repositories under
        the project. It gives access to the admin features of a project only,
        not direct access to its repositories' contents.


        * ability to create the project

        * ability to update the project

        * ability to delete the project


        #### repository


        Provides read access to a repository or repositories.

        Note that this scope does not give access to a repository's pull
        requests.


        * access to the repo's source code

        * clone over HTTPS

        * access the file browsing API

        * download zip archives of the repo's contents

        * the ability to view and use the issue tracker on any repo (created
        issues, comment, vote, etc)

        * the ability to view and use the wiki on any repo (create/edit pages)


        #### repository:write


        Provides write (not admin) access to a repository or repositories. No
        distinction is made between public and private repositories. This scope
        implicitly grants the [`repository`](#repository) scope, which does not
        need to be requested separately.

        This scope alone does not give access to the pull requests API.


        * push access over HTTPS

        * fork repos


        #### repository:admin


        Provides admin access to a repository or repositories. No distinction is
        made between public and private repositories. This scope doesn't
        implicitly grant the [`repository`](#repository) or the
        [`repository:write`](#repository-write) scopes. It gives access to the
        admin features of a repo only, not direct access to its contents. This
        scope can be used or misused to grant read access to other users, who
        can then clone the repo, but users that need to read and write source
        code would also request explicit read or write.

        This scope comes with access to the following functionality:


        * View and manipulate committer mappings

        * List and edit deploy keys

        * Ability to delete the repo

        * View and edit repo permissions

        * View and edit branch permissions

        * Import and export the issue tracker

        * Enable and disable the issue tracker

        * List and edit issue tracker version, milestones and components

        * Enable and disable the wiki

        * List and edit default reviewers

        * List and edit repo links (Jira/Bamboo/Custom)

        * List and edit the repository webhooks

        * Initiate a repo ownership transfer


        #### repository:delete


        Provides access to delete a repository or repositories.


        #### pullrequest


        Provides read access to pull requests.

        This scope implies the [`repository`](#repository) scope, giving read
        access to the pull request's destination repository.


        * see and list pull requests

        * create and resolve tasks

        * comment on pull requests


        #### pullrequest:write


        Implicitly grants the [`pullrequest`](#pullrequest) scope and adds the
        ability to create, merge and decline pull requests.

        This scope also implicitly grants the
        [`repository:write`](#repository-write) scope, giving write access to
        the pull request's destination repository. This is necessary to allow
        merging.


        * merge pull requests

        * decline pull requests

        * create pull requests

        * approve pull requests


        #### issue


        Ability to interact with issue trackers the way non-repo members can.

        This scope doesn't implicitly grant any other scopes and doesn't give
        implicit access to the repository.


        * view, list and search issues

        * create new issues

        * comment on issues

        * watch issues

        * vote for issues


        #### issue:write


        This scope implicitly grants the [`issue`](#issue) scope and adds the
        ability to transition and delete issues.

        This scope doesn't implicitly grant any other scopes and doesn't give
        implicit access to the repository.


        * transition issues

        * delete issues


        #### wiki


        Provides access to wikis. This scope provides both read and write access
        (wikis are always editable by anyone with access to them).

        This scope doesn't implicitly grant any other scopes and doesn't give
        implicit access to the repository.


        * view wikis

        * create pages

        * edit pages

        * push to wikis

        * clone wikis


        #### webhook


        Gives access to webhooks. This scope is required for any webhook-related
        operation.


        This scope gives read access to existing webhook subscriptions on all

        resources the authorization mechanism can access, without needing
        further scopes.

        For example:


        - A client can list all existing webhook subscriptions on a repository.
        The [`repository`](#repository) scope is not required.

        - Existing webhook subscriptions for the issue tracker on a repo can be
        retrieved without the [`issue`](#issue) scope. All that is required is
        the `webhook` scope.


        To create webhooks, the client will need read access to the resource.
        Such as: for [`issue:created`](#issue-created), the client will need to

        have both the `webhook` and the [`issue`](#issue) scope.


        * list webhook subscriptions on any accessible repository, user, team,
        or snippet

        * create/update/delete webhook subscriptions.


        #### snippet


        Provides read access to snippets.

        No distinction is made between public and private snippets (public
        snippets are accessible without any form of authentication).


        * view any snippet

        * create snippet comments


        #### snippet:write


        Provides write access to snippets.

        No distinction is made between public and private snippets (public
        snippets are accessible without any form of authentication).

        This scope implicitly grants the [`snippet`](#snippet) scope which does
        not need to be requested separately.


        * create snippets

        * edit snippets

        * delete snippets


        #### email


        Ability to see the user's primary email address. This should make it
        easier to use Bitbucket Cloud as a login provider for apps or external
        applications.


        #### account


        When used for:

        * **user-related APIs** — Gives read-only access to the user's account
        information.

        Note that this doesn't include any ability to change any of the data.
        This scope allows you to view the user's:
          * email addresses
          * language
          * location
          * website
          * full name
          * SSH keys
          * user groups
        * **workspace-related APIs** — Grants access to view the workspace's:
          * users
          * user permissions
          * projects

        #### account:write


        Ability to change properties on the user's account.


        * delete the authorizing user's account

        * manage the user's groups

        * change a user's email addresses

        * change username, display name and avatar


        #### pipeline


        Gives read-only access to pipelines, steps, deployment environments and
        variables.


        #### pipeline:write


        Gives write access to pipelines. This scope allows a user to:

        * Stop pipelines

        * Rerun failed pipelines

        * Resume halted pipelines

        * Trigger manual pipelines.


        This scope is not needed to trigger a build using a push. Performing a
        `git push` (or equivalent actions) will trigger the build. The token
        doing the push only needs the [`repository:write`](#repository-write)
        scope.


        This doesn't give write access to create variables.


        #### pipeline:variable


        Gives write access to create variables in pipelines at the various
        levels:

        * Workspace

        * Repository

        * Deployment


        #### runner


        Gives read-only access to pipelines runners setup against a workspace or
        repository.


        #### runner:write


        Gives write access to create/edit/disable/delete pipelines runners setup
        against a workspace or repository.

        ### Forge app scopes


        In order for a Forge app integration to access Bitbucket API endpoints,
        it needs to include certain privilege scopes in the app manifest. These
        are different from Bitbucket OAuth 2.0 scopes.


        Unlike OAuth 2.0 scopes, Forge app scopes do not implicitly grant other
        scopes, for example, `write:repository:bitbucket` does not implicitly
        grant `read:repository:bitbucket`.


        Only a subset of Bitbucket API endpoints are currently available for
        Forge app integrations. These will be labeled with Forge app scopes.


        Our best practice suggests you only add the scopes your app needs, but
        no more than it needs.


        The available scopes are:


        - [`read:repository:bitbucket`](#read-repository-bitbucket)

        - [`write:repository:bitbucket`](#write-repository-bitbucket)

        - [`admin:repository:bitbucket`](#admin-repository-bitbucket)

        - [`delete:repository:bitbucket`](#delete-repository-bitbucket)

        - [`read:pullrequest:bitbucket`](#read-pullrequest-bitbucket)

        - [`write:pullrequest:bitbucket`](#write-pullrequest-bitbucket)

        - [`read:project:bitbucket`](#read-project-bitbucket)

        - [`admin:project:bitbucket`](#admin-project-bitbucket)

        - [`read:workspace:bitbucket`](#read-workspace-bitbucket)

        - [`read:user:bitbucket`](#read-user-bitbucket)

        - [`read:pipeline:bitbucket`](#read-pipeline-bitbucket)

        - [`write:pipeline:bitbucket`](#write-pipeline-bitbucket)

        - [`admin:pipeline:bitbucket`](#admin-pipeline-bitbucket)

        - [`read:runner:bitbucket`](#read-runner-bitbucket)

        - [`write:runner:bitbucket`](#write-runner-bitbucket)


        #### read:repository:bitbucket


        Allows viewing of repository data. Note that this scope does not give
        access to a repository's pull requests.

        * access to the repository's source code

        * access the file browsing API

        * access to certain repository configurations such as branching model,
        default reviewers, etc.


        #### write:repository:bitbucket


        Allows modification of repository data. No distinction is made between
        public and private repositories. This scope does not imply the
        `read:repository:bitbucket` scope, so you need to request that
        separately if required. This scope alone does not give access to the
        pull request API.

        * update/delete source, branches, tags, etc.

        * fork repositories


        #### admin:repository:bitbucket


        Allows admin activities on repositories. No distinction is made between
        public and private repositories. This scope does not implicitly grant
        the `read:repository:bitbucket` or the `write:repository:bitbucket`
        scopes. It gives access to the admin features of a repository only, not
        direct access to its contents. This scope does not allow modification of
        repository permissions. This scope comes with access to the following
        functionality:

        * create repository

        * view repository permissions

        * view and edit branch restrictions

        * edit branching model settings

        * edit default reviewers

        * view and edit inheritance state for repository settings


        #### delete:repository:bitbucket

        Allows deletion of repositories.


        #### read:pullrequest:bitbucket

        Allows viewing of pull requests, plus the ability to comment on pull
        requests.


        This scope does not imply the `read:repository:bitbucket` scope. With
        this scope, you could retrieve some data specific to the
        source/destination repositories of a pull request using pull request
        endpoints, but it does not give access to repository API endpoints.


        #### write:pullrequest:bitbucket

        Allows the ability to create, update, approve, decline, and merge pull
        requests.


        This scope does not imply the `write:repository:bitbucket` scope.


        #### read:project:bitbucket

        Allows viewing of project and project permission data.


        #### admin:project:bitbucket

        Allows the ability to create, update, and delete project. No distinction
        is made between public and private projects.


        This scope does not implicitly grant the `read:project:bitbucket` scope
        or any repository scopes. It gives access to the admin features of a
        project only, not direct access to its repositories' contents.


        #### read:workspace:bitbucket

        Allows viewing of workspace and workspace permission data.


        #### read:user:bitbucket

        Allows viewing of user data. This scope is typically required for
        permission related endpoints.


        #### read:pipeline:bitbucket

        Allows read access to all pipeline information (pipelines, steps,
        caches, artifacts, logs, tests, code-insights).


        #### write:pipeline:bitbucket

        Allows running pipelines (i.e., start/stop/create pipeline) and
        uploading tests/code-insights.


        This scope does not imply the `read:pipeline:bitbucket` scope.


        #### admin:pipeline:bitbucket

        Allows admin activities, such as creating pipeline variables.


        This scope does not implicitly grant the `read:pipeline:bitbucket` or
        the `write:pipeline:bitbucket` scopes.


        #### read:runner:bitbucket

        Allows viewing of runners information.


        #### write:runner:bitbucket

        Allows runners management.


        This scope does not imply the `read:runners:bitbucket` scope.

      body: "\nYou can query the 2.0 API for specific objects using a simple language which resembles SQL.\n\nNote that filtering and querying by username has been deprecated, due to privacy changes. \nSee the [announcement](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/bitbucket-api-changes-gdpr/#changes-to-querying) \nfor details.\n\n\n\n* [Supported endpoints](#supported-endpoints)\n* [Operators](#operators)\n* [Data types](#data-types)\n* [Querying](#querying)\n* [Sorting query results](#sorting-query-results)\n\n-\n\n### Supported endpoints\n\nMost 2.0 API resources that return paginated collections of objects support a single, shared, generic querying language that is used to filter down a result set.\n\nThis includes, but is in no way limited to:\n\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/branches\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/tags\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/forks\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/src\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/issues\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests\n\nFiltering and sorting supports several distinct operators and data types as well as basic features, like logical operators (AND, OR).\nAs examples, the following queries could be used on the issue tracker endpoint (`/2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{slug}/issues/`):\n\n\t(state = \"open\" OR state = \"new\") AND assignee = null\n\treporter.nickname != \"evzijst\" AND priority >= \"major\"\n\t(title ~ \"unicode\" OR content.raw ~ \"unicode\") AND created_on > 2015-10-04T14:00:00-07:00\n\nFilter queries can be added to the URL using the q=<query> query parameter. To sort the response, add sort=<field>. Note that the entire query string is put in the q parameter and hence needs to be URL-encoded as shown in the following example:\n\n\t/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=state=\"new\"&sort=-updated_on\n\n\n### Operators\n\nFiltering and sorting supports the following operators:\n\n| Operator | Definition                     | Example                    |\n|-|--|-|\n| \"=\"      | test for equality              | `nickname = \"evzijst\"`     |\n| \"!=\"     | not equal                      | `is_private != true`       |\n| \"~\"      | case-insensitive text contains | `description ~ \"beef\"`     |\n| \"!~\"     | case-insensitive not contains  | `description !~ \"fubar\"`   |\n| \">\"      | greater than                   | `priority > \"major\"`       |\n| \">=\"     | greater than or equal          | `priority <= \"trivial\"`    |\n| \"<\"      | less than                      | `id < 1234`                |\n| \"<=\"     | less than or equal             | `updated_on <= 2015-03-04` |\n\n### Data types\n\nFiltering and sorting supports the following data types:\n\n| Type         | Description                             | Example       |\n|--|--||\n| **String**   | any text inside double quotes           | `\"foo\"`       |\n| **Number**   | arbitrary precision integers and floats | `1, -10.302`  |\n| **Null**     | to test for the absence of a value      | `null`        |\n| **boolean**  | the unquoted strings true or false      | `true, false` |\n| **datetime** | an unquoted [ISO-8601][iso-8601] date time string with the timezone offset, milliseconds and entire time component being optional | `2015-03-04T14:08:59.123+02:00`, `2015-03-04T14:08:59` Date time strings are assumed to be in UTC, unless an explicit timezone offset is provided |\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601]: /iso-8601\n\n### Querying\n\nObjects can be filtered based on their properties. In principle, every element in an object's JSON document schema can be used as a filter criterion.\n\nNote that while the array of objects in a paginated response is wrapped in an\nenvelope with a `values` element, this prefix should not be included in the\nquery fields (so use `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=state=\"new\"`, not\n`/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=values.state=\"new\"`).\n\n\n### Examples\n\nFields that contain embedded instances of other object types (e.g. owner is an embedded user object, while parent is an embedded repository) can be traversed recursively. For instance:\n\n\tparent.owner.nickname = \"bitbucket\"\n\nTo find pull requests which merge into master, come from a fork of the repo rather than a branch inside the repo, and on which I am a reviewer:\n\n```\nsource.repository.full_name != \"main/repo\" AND state = \"OPEN\" AND reviewers.nickname = \"evzijst\" AND destination.branch.name = \"master\"\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/main/repo/pullrequests?q=source.repository.full_name+%21%3D+%22main%2Frepo%22+AND+state+%3D+%22OPEN%22+AND+reviewers.nickname+%3D+%22evzijst%22+AND+destination.branch.name+%3D+%22master%22\n```\n\nTo find new or on-hold issues related to the UI, created or updated in the last day (SF local time), that have not yet been assigned to anyone:\n\n```\n(state = \"new\" OR state = \"on hold\") AND assignee = null AND component = \"UI\" and updated_on > 2015-11-11T00:00:00-07:00\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/main/repo/issues?q=%28state+%3D+%22new%22+OR+state+%3D+%22on+hold%22%29+AND+assignee+%3D+null+AND+component+%3D+%22UI%22+and+updated_on+%3E+2015-11-11T00%3A00%3A00-07%3A00\n```\n\nTo find all tags with the string \"2015\" in the name:\n\n```\nname ~ \"2015\"\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/tags?q=name+%7E+%222015%22\n```\nOr all my branches:\n\n```\nname ~ \"erik/\"\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/?q=name+%7E+%22erik%2F%22\n```\n### Sorting query results\n\nYou can sort result sets using the ?sort=<field> query parameter, available on the same resources that support filtering:\n\n* In principle, every field that can be queried can also be used as a key for sorting.\n* By default the sort order is ascending. To reverse the order, prefix the field name with a hyphen (e.g. ?sort=-updated_on).\n* Only one field can be sorted on. Compound fields (e.g. sort on state first, followed by updated_on) are not supported.\n\n\n"

        Endpoints that return collections of objects should always apply
        pagination.

        Paginated collections are always wrapped in the following wrapper
        object:


        ```json

        {
          "size": 5421,
          "page": 2,
          "pagelen": 10,
          "next": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=3",
          "previous": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=1",
          "values": [
            ...
          ]
        }

        ```


        Pagination is often page-bound, with a query parameter page indicating
        which

        page is to be returned.


        However, clients are not expected to construct URLs themselves by
        manipulating

        the page number query parameter. Instead, the response contains a link
        to the

        next page. This link should be treated as an opaque location that is not
        to be

        constructed by clients or even assumed to be predictable. The only
        contract

        around the next link is that it will return the next chunk of results.


        Lack of a next link in the response indicates the end of the collection.


        The paginated response contains the following fields:


        | Field      | Value    |

        ||-|

        | `size`     | Total number of objects in the response. This is an
        optional element that is not provided in all responses, as it can be
        expensive to compute. |

        | `page`     | Page number of the current results. This is an optional
        element that is not provided in all responses. |

        | `pagelen`  | Current number of objects on the existing page. Globally,
        the minimum length is 10 and the maximum is 100. Some APIs may specify a
        different default. |

        | `next`     | Link to the next page if it exists. The last page of a
        collection does not have this value. Use this link to navigate the
        result set and refrain from constructing your own URLs. |

        | `previous` | Link to previous page if it exists. A collections first
        page does not have this value. This is an optional element that is not
        provided in all responses. Some result sets strictly support forward
        navigation and never provide previous links. Clients must anticipate
        that backwards navigation is not always available. Use this link to
        navigate the result set and refrain from constructing your own URLs. |

        | `values`   | The list of objects. This contains at most `pagelen`
        objects. |


        The link to the next page is included such that you don't have to
        hardcode or construct any links.  Only values and next are guaranteed
        (except the last page, which lacks next). This is because the previous
        and size values can be expensive for some data sets.


        It is important to realize that Bitbucket support both list-based
        pagination and iterator-based pagination. List-based pagination assumes
        that the collection is a discrete, immutable, consistently ordered,
        finite array of objects with a fixed size. Clients navigate a list-based
        collection by requesting offset-based chunks. In Bitbucket Cloud,
        list-based responses include the optional size, page, and previous
        element. The the next and previous links typically resemble something
        like /foo/bar?page=4.


        However, not all result sets can be treated as immutable and finite –
        much like how programming languages tend to distinguish between lists
        and arrays on one hand and iterators or stream on the other. Where an
        list-based pagination offers random access into any point in a
        collection, iterator-based pagination can only navigate forward one
        element at a time. In Bitbucket such iterator-based pagination contains
        the next link and pagelen elements, but not necessarily anything else.
        In these cases, the next link's value often contains an unpredictable
        hash instead of an explicit page number. The commits resource uses
        iterator-based pagination.

        By default, each endpoint returns the full representation of a resource
        and in

        some cases that can be a lot of data. For example, retrieving a list of
        pull

        requests can amount to quite a large document.


        For better performance, you can ask the server to only return the fields
        you

        really need and to omit unwanted data. To request a partial response and
        to

        add or remove specific fields from a response, use the `fields` query

        parameter.



        ### Example


        Most API resources embed a substantial list of links pointing to related

        resources. This saves the client from constructing its own URLs, but is

        somewhat wasteful when the client doesn't need them.


        To significantly reduce the size of the response, use `?fields=-links`:


        ```json

        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links

        {
          "nickname": "evzijst",
          "account_status": "active",
          "website": "",
          "display_name": "Erik van Zijst",
          "uuid": "{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}",
          "created_on": "2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00",
          "location": null,
          "type": "user"
        }

        ```


        ### Fields parameter syntax


        The `fields` parameter supports 3 modes of operation:


        1. Removal of select fields (e.g. `-links`)

        2. Pulling in additional fields not normally returned by an endpoint,
        while
           still getting all the default fields (e.g. `+reviewers`)
        3. Omitting all fields, except those specified (e.g.
        `owner.display_name`)


        The fields parameter can contain a list of multiple comma-separated
        field names

        (e.g. `fields=owner.display_name,uuid,links.self.href`). The parameter
        itself is

        not repeated.


        As discussed at [Condensed Versus Full
        Objects](serialization#representations),

        most objects that are embedded inside other objects (like how `owner` is
        an

        embedded `user` object in `repository`) appear in "condensed" form that
        omits

        many fields. The `fields` parameter allows us to pull in additional
        fields in

        such cases.


        For example, the embedded repository object in a pull request does not
        normally

        contain its `owner`. To add that in we can use:

        `+values.destination.repository.owner`.



        ### Wildcards


        The asterisk can be used to match all fields on a particular level. For

        example, removing all entries from the `links` element can be done like
        this:


        ```json

        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links.*

        {
          "nickname": "evzijst",
          "account_status": "active",
          "website": "",
          "display_name": "Erik van Zijst",
          "uuid": "{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}",
          "links": {},
          "created_on": "2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00",
          "location": null,
          "type": "user"
        }

        ```


        Wildcards can be used in combination with exclusion and inclusion. For

        instance, `-*,+foo,+bar` will remove all elements from the root level
        and then

        add in `foo` and `bar`.



        ### URL encoding


        Be aware that when using the `+foo.bar` syntax in the query string, that
        the

        "+" must be URL encoded as "%2B" and so the URL will be:


        ```

        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/interruptingcow?fields=%2Bowner.created_on

        ```


        Without URL escaping, "+" is interpreted as an encoded space which will
        not

        match any fields.



        ### Field discovery


        While a resource's `self` URL, as well its "collection" URL typically
        return

        the full object with all its fields, there are some exceptions for
        fields that

        are overly verbose or costly to generate.


        For instance, a pull request contains the embedded lists of reviewers
        and

        participants. These fields are included from the `self` URL, but not
        from the

        `/pullrequests` collections resource, as it would impact performance too
        much.


        To discover any additional fields that might not be included by default,

        `fields=*` can be used.



        ### More examples


        If we want to get a list of all reviewer nicknames on pull requests I
        created,

        we could combine a [filter](filtering) with a partial response. This
        will omit

        all other data from the response:


        ```

        /2.0/repositories/bitbucket/bitbucket/pullrequests?fields=values.id,values.reviewers.nickname,values.state&q=author.uuid%3D%22%7Bd301aafa-d676-4ee0-88be-962be7417567%7D%22

        ### Open API Specification


        Bitbucket uses the [Open API Specification](https://openapis.org) (OAI,

        formerly known as Swagger) to describe its APIs. Our OAI specification
        schema

        is hosted at
        [https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json](https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json)

        and serves as the canonical definition and comprehensive declaration of
        all

        available endpoints.


        The OAI specification makes writing client applications easier by:

        auto-generating boilerplate code (like data object classes) and dealing
        with

        authentication and error handling.


        You can find a comprehensive set of open tools for the OAI specification
        at:

        [https://github.com/swagger-api](https://github.com/swagger-api).



        ### JSON Schema


        Bitbucket uses JSON Schema to describe the layout of every type of
        object

        consumed or produced by the API. These schemas are collected under the

        `#definitions` element of our swagger.json file.


        When an endpoint expects an object as part of a POST or PUT, it also
        expects

        the object to validate against the JSON schemas. The same applies to
        objects

        returned by an endpoint.



        ### Condensed Versus Full Objects


        Most objects in Bitbucket come both in "full" and "partial"
        representation.

        The full representation is when all elements are included. This is the
        layout

        returned by a resource's `self` location (e.g.
        `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar`),

        as well as resource collection endpoints (e.g. `/2.0/repositories`).


        However, Bitbucket objects often embed other objects. For example, a
        `repository`

        object embeds a `user` object for its owner. Likewise, a `pullrequest`
        object

        embeds its `repository` object.


        These related objects are embedded, or inlined, to reduce the "chatter"
        when

        clients make frequent followup API calls to collect information on
        common,

        related information.


        Embedded related objects are typically limited in their fields to avoid
        such

        object graphs from becoming too deep and noisy. They often exclude their
        own

        nested objects in an attempt to strike a balance between performance and

        utility.


        An object's embedded or condensed representation tends to be
        standardized,

        meaning the fields included is the same set, regardless of where the
        object

        was embedded.

        You should be familiar with REST architecture before writing an
        integration. Read this overview page to gain a good understanding of
        Bitbucket's REST implementation.

        ### URI structure


        All Bitbucket Cloud requests start with the
        `https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0` prefix (for the 2.0 API) and
        `https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0` prefix (1.0 API).


        The next segment of the URI path depends on the endpoint of the request.
        For example, using the curl command and the repositories endpoint you
        can list all the issues on Bitbucket's tutorial repository:


        ```

        curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org

        ```

        Given a specific endpoint, you can then drill down to a particular
        aspect or resource of that endpoint. The issues resource on a repository
        is an example:


        ```

        curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org/issues

        ```


        #### HTTP methods


        A given endpoint or resource has a series of actions (or methods)
        associated with it. The Bitbucket service supports these standard HTTP
        methods:


        | Call | Description |

        ||-|

        | GET    | Retrieves information. |

        | PUT    | Updates existing information. |

        | POST   | Creates new information. |

        | DELETE | Removes existing information. |


        For example, you can call use the POST action on the issues resource and
        create an issue on the issue tracker.


        **Specifying content length**


        You can get a `411 Length Required` response. If this happens, the API
        requires a Content-Length header but the client is not sending it. You
        should add the header yourself, for example using the curl client:


        ```

        curl -r PUT --header "Content-Length: 0" -u user:app_password
        https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/emails/rap@atlassian.com

        ```


        ### Universally Unique Identifier


        UUID's provide a single point of recognition for users, teams, and
        repositories. The UUID is distinct from the username, team name, and
        repository name fields and remains the same even when those fields
        change. For example when a user changes their username or moves a
        repository you will need to modify calls which use those identifiers but
        not if you are pointing to the UUID.


        #### UUID examples and structure


        UUID's work with both the 1.0 and 2.0 APIs for the user, team, and
        repository objects. The following examples the following characters are
        replacements for curly brackets: `%7B` replaces `{`  and `%7D` replaces
        `}`. You will see this structure in the following example sections.


        #### User object and UUID


        When you make a call using either the username or the UUID for that user
        the response is the same.


        **Call with username**:


        ```

        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials

        ```


        ***Call with UUID for the user**:


        ```

        curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7Bc788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007%7D

        ```

            "type": "user"
        }

        ```


        #### Repository object and UUID


        Once you have the UUID for a repository you no longer need a username or
        team name to make the API call so long as you use an empty field. This
        helps you resolve repositories no matter if the username or team name
        changes.


        **Call with team name (1team) and repository name (moxie)**:


        ```

        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/moxie

        ```

        **Call with UUID and empty field**:


        ```

        curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/%7B%7D/%7B21fa9bf8-b5b2-4891-97ed-d590bad0f871%7D

        ```


        **Call with UUID and teamname**:

        #### Team object and UUID


        This example shows a call for a list of team members using both the team
        name and with the UUID for the team object. As the call is
        unauthenticated in the following example the response object will only
        show members with public profiles. The response is the same in either
        case.


        **Call with teamname**


        ```

        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/1team/members

        ```

        **Call with UUID for team object**


        ```

        curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/%7Baa559944-83c9-4963-a9a8-69ac8d9cf5d2%7D/members

        ### Standardized error responses


        The 2.0 API standardizes the error response layout. The 2.0 API serves a
        JSON

        object along with the appropriate HTTP status code. The JSON object
        provides a

        detailed  problem description.


        ```json

        {
            "type": "error",
            "error": {
                "message": "Bad request",
                "fields": {
                    "src": [
                        "This field is required."
                    ]
                },
                "detail": "You must specify a valid source branch when creating a pull request.",
                "id": "d23a1cc5178f7637f3d9bf2d13824258",
                "data": {
                  "extra": "Optional, endpoint-specific data to further augment the error."
                }
            }
        }

        ```


        This object contains an error element which contains the following
        nested

        elements:


        | Element | Description |

        ||-|

        | message | A short description of the problem. This element is always
        present. Its value may be localized. |

        | fields  | This optional element is used in response to POST or PUT
        operations in which clients have provided invalid input. It contains a
        list of one or more client-provided fields that failed validation. The
        values may be localized. |

        | detail  | An optional detailed explanation of the failure. Its value
        may be localized.

        | id      | An optional unique error identifier that identifies the
        error in Bitbucket's logging system. If you feel you hit a bug in an API
        and this field is provided, please mention it if you decide to contact
        support as it will greatly help us narrow down the problem. |


        ### Standard ISO-8601 timestamps


        All 2.0 APIs use standardized ISO-8601 timestamps. In most cases, our
        APIs return UTC timestamps and for these, the timezone offset part will
        be 00:00. In rare cases where the original localized timestamp has
        significance, the timezone offset may identify the event's original
        timezone.

        ### Cors


        The Bitbucket API supports Cross-origin resource sharing to allow
        requests for restricted resources across domains. For more information
        you can refer to:


        * [Wikipedia article on
        CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)

        * [W3C CORS recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)


        Sending a general request from the api to bitbucket.com:


        `curl -i https://api.bitbucket.org -H "origin: http://bitbucket.com"`


        Gives this result:

        ### Supported content types


        The default and primary content type for 2.0 APIs is JSON. This applies
        both to responses from the server and to the request bodies provided by
        the client.


        Unless documented otherwise, whenever creating a new (POST) or modifying
        an existing (PUT) object, your client must provide the object's normal
        representation. Not every object element can be mutated. For example, a
        repository's created_on date is an auto-generated, immutable field. Your
        client can omit immutable fields from a request body.


        In some cases, a resource might also accept regular
        application/x-www-url-form-encoded POST and PUT bodies. Such bodies can
        be more convenient in scripts and command line usage. Requests bodies
        can contain contain nested elements or they can be flat (without nested
        elements). Clients can send flat request bodies as either as
        application/json or as application/x-www-url-form-encoded. Nested
        objects always require JSON.


        ### Resource links


        Every 2.0 object contains a links element that points to related
        resources or alternate representations. Use links to quickly discover
        and traverse to related objects. Links serve a "self-documenting"
        function for each endpoint. For example, the following request for a
        specific user:



        `$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials`


        ```json

        {
            "username": "tutorials",
            "nickname": "tutorials",
            "account_status": "active",
            "website": "https://tutorials.bitbucket.org/",
            "display_name": "tutorials account",
            "uuid": "{c788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007}",
            "links": {
                "self": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials"
                },
                "repositories": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials"
                },
                "html": {
                    "href": "https://bitbucket.org/tutorials"
                },
                "followers": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/followers"
                },
                "avatar": {
                    "href": "https://bitbucket-assetroot.s3.amazonaws.com/c/photos/2013/Nov/25/tutorials-avatar-1563784409-6_avatar.png"
                },
                "following": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/following"
                }
            },
            "created_on": "2011-12-20T16:34:07.132459+00:00",
            "location": "Santa Monica, CA",
            "type": "user"
        }

        ```

        Links can be actual REST API resources or they can be informational. In
        this example, informative resources include the user's avatar and the
        HTML URL for the user's Bitbucket account. Your client should avoid
        hardcoding an API's URL and instead use the URLs returned in API
        responses.


        A link's key is its `rel` (relationship) attribute and it contains a
        mandatory href element. For example, the following link:


        ```json

        "self": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials"
        }

        ```


        The rel for this link is self and the href is
        https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials. A single rel key can
        contain an list (array) of href objects. Your client should anticipate
        that any rel key can contain one or more href objects.


        Finally, links can also contain optional elements. Two common optional
        elements are the name element and the title element. They are often used
        to disambiguate links that share the same rel key. In the example below,
        the repository object that contains a clone link with two href objects.
        Each object contains the optional name element to clarify its use.


        ```json

        "links": {
          "self": {
            "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/bitbucket"
          },
          "clone": [
            {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/evzijst/bitbucket.git",
              "name": "https"
            },
            {
              "href": "ssh://git@bitbucket.org/erik/bitbucket.git",
              "name": "ssh"
            }
          ],
          ...
        }

        ```

        Links can support [URI Templates](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570);
        Those that do contain a `"templated": "true"` element.
