        As an experimental feature, this operation can also attempt to
        type-check the expressions.

            The check to perform:

             *  `syntax` Each expression's syntax is checked to ensure the expression can be parsed. Also, syntactic limits are validated. For example, the expression's length.
             *  `type` EXPERIMENTAL. Each expression is type checked and the final type of the expression inferred. Any type errors that would result in the expression failure at runtime are reported. For example, accessing properties that don't exist or passing the wrong number of arguments to functions. Also performs the syntax check.
             *  `complexity` EXPERIMENTAL. Determines the formulae for how many [expensive operations](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/#expensive-operations) each expression may execute.

        This resource can be used to test Jira expressions that you plan to use
        elsewhere, or to fetch data in a flexible way. Consult the [Jira
        expressions
        documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/)
        for more details.


        #### Context variables ####


        The following context variables are available to Jira expressions
        evaluated by this resource. Their presence depends on various factors;
        usually you need to manually request them in the context object sent in
        the payload, but some of them are added automatically under certain
        conditions.

         *  `user` ([User](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user)): The current user. Always available and equal to `null` if the request is anonymous.
         *  `app` ([App](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#app)): The [Connect app](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps) that made the request. Available only for authenticated requests made by Connect Apps (read more here: [Authentication for Connect apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/)).
         *  `issue` ([Issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): The current issue. Available only when the issue is provided in the request context object.
         *  `issues` ([List](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#list) of [Issues](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)): A collection of issues matching a JQL query. Available only when JQL is provided in the request context object.
         *  `project` ([Project](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#project)): The current project. Available only when the project is provided in the request context object.
         *  `sprint` ([Sprint](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#sprint)): The current sprint. Available only when the sprint is provided in the request context object.
         *  `board` ([Board](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#board)): The current board. Available only when the board is provided in the request context object.
         *  `serviceDesk` ([ServiceDesk](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#servicedesk)): The current service desk. Available only when the service desk is provided in the request context object.
         *  `customerRequest` ([CustomerRequest](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#customerrequest)): The current customer request. Available only when the customer request is provided in the request context object.

        Also, custom context variables can be passed in the request with their
        types. Those variables can be accessed by key in the Jira expression.
        These variable types are available for use in a custom context:

         *  `user`: A [user](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user) specified as an Atlassian account ID.
         *  `issue`: An [issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue) specified by ID or key. All the fields of the issue object are available in the Jira expression.
         *  `json`: A JSON object containing custom content.
         *  `list`: A JSON list of `user`, `issue`, or `json` variable types.

        This operation can be accessed anonymously.


        **[Permissions](#permissions) required**: None. However, an expression
        may return different results for different users depending on their
        permissions. For example, different users may see different comments on
        the same issue.  

        Permission to access Jira Software is required to access Jira Software
        context variables (`board` and `sprint`) or fields (for example,
        `issue.sprint`).

            information about the expression complexity. For example, the number
            of expensive operations used by the expression and how close the
            expression is to reaching the [complexity
            limit](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/#restrictions).
            Useful when designing and debugging your expressions.

        The Jira REST API enables you to interact with Jira programmatically.
        Use this API to 

        [build
        apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/integrating-with-jira-cloud/),
        script interactions with 

        Jira, or develop any other type of integration. This page documents the
        REST resources available in Jira Cloud, including 

        the HTTP response codes and example requests and responses.
      title: About
    - anchor: version
      body: >
        This documentation is for **version 3** of the Jira Cloud platform REST
        API, which is the latest version

        but is in **beta**. [Version
        2](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/) and 

        version 3 of the API offer the same collection of operations. However,
        version 3 provides support for 

        the [Atlassian Document
        Format](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/apis/document/structure/) 

        (ADF) in: 

        - `body` in comments, including where comments are used in issue, issue
        link, and transition resources.

        - `comment` in worklogs.

        - `description` and `environment` fields in issues.

        - `textarea` type custom fields (multi-line text fields) in issues.
        Single line custom fields 
          (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.

        However, these new features are under development and may change.

        ### Forge apps


        For Forge apps, [REST API
        scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/scopes-for-oauth-2-3LO-and-forge-apps/) 

        are used when authenticating with Jira Cloud platform. See [Add scopes
        to call an Atlassian REST
        API](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/add-scopes-to-call-an-atlassian-rest-api/)
        for more details.


        The URIs for Forge app REST API calls have this structure:


        `/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


        For example, `/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`


        ### Connect apps


        For Connect apps, authentication (JWT-based) is built into the Connect
        libraries. Authorization is implemented using either 

        scopes (shown as _App scope required_ for operations on this page) or
        user impersonation. See 

        [Security for Connect
        apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/) 

        for details.


        The URIs for Connect app REST API calls have this structure:


        `https://<site-url>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


        For example, `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`


        ### Other integrations


        For integrations that are not Forge or Connect apps, use OAuth 2.0
        authorization code grants (3LO) for security 

        (3LO scopes are shown as for operations _OAuth scopes required_). See 

        [OAuth 2.0 (3LO)
        apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/) 

        for details.


        The URIs for OAuth 2.0 (3LO) app REST API calls have this structure:

        For example,

        ### Ad-hoc API calls


        For personal scripts, bots, and ad-hoc execution of the REST APIs use
        basic authentication. See [Basic auth for REST
        APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/)
        for details. 


        The URIs for basic authentication REST API calls have this structure:


        `https://<site-url>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`


        For example, `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`

        ### Operation permissions


        Most operations in this API require permissions. The calling user must
        have the required permissions for an operation to 

        use it. Note that for Connect apps, the app user must have the required
        permissions for the operation and the app must 

        have scopes that permit the operation.


        A permission can be granted to a group, project role, or issue role that
        the user is a member of, or granted directly to a user. 

        See [Permissions overview](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ)
        for details. The most common permissions are:


        - **Administer the Cloud site**: Users in the _site-admins_ group have
        this 

        permission. See [Manage
        groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) for details.

        - **Administer Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Administrators_ global
        permission. There is a default group for this permission. 

        See [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) and
        [Managing global permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg)
        for details.

        - **Administer a project in Jira**: Granted by the _Administer projects_
        project permission for a project. This can be 

        granted to a user, a group, a project role, and more. 

        See [Managing project
        permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for details.

        - **Access a project in Jira**: Granted by the _Browse projects_ project
        permission for a project. This can be 

        granted to a user, a group, a project role, and more. 

        See [Managing project
        permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for details.

        - **Access Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Users_ global permission. Users
        in the default product access group (for example, 

        _jira-software-users-acmesite_) have this permission. 

        See [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) and 

        [Managing global permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg)
        for details.


        ### Anonymous access


        Some operations provide support for anonymous access. However, anonymous
        access is only available if 

        the Jira permission needed to access the object or records returned by
        the operation is granted to 

        the _Public_ group. See [Allowing anonymous access to your
        project](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/GDxxLg) 

        for details.


        If an operation is called anonymously and anonymous access is not
        available, the operation will return 

        an error. Note that not all operations that correspond to objects that
        can be given public access 

        provide for anonymous access.
      title: Permissions
    - anchor: expansion
      body: >+
        ### Expansion


        The Jira REST API uses resource expansion, which means that some parts
        of a resource are not returned unless specified 

        in the request. This simplifies responses and minimizes network traffic.


        To expand part of a resource in a request, use the expand query
        parameter and specify the object(s) to be expanded. 

        If you need to expand nested objects, use the `.` dot notation. If you
        need to expand multiple objects, use a 

        comma-separated list. 


        For example, the following request expands the `names` and
        `renderedFields` properties for the _JRACLOUD-34423_ issue:


        `GET issue/JRACLOUD-34423?expand=names,renderedFields`


        To discover which object can be expanded, refer to the `expand` property
        in the object. 

        In the JSON example below, the resource declares `widgets` as
        expandable.


        ```json

        {
          "expand": "widgets", 
          "self": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/resource/KEY-1", 
          "widgets": {
            "widgets": [],
            "size": 5
           }
        }

        ```


        ### Pagination


        The Jira REST API uses pagination to improve performance. Pagination is
        enforced for operations that could return a large 

        collection of items. When you make a request to a paginated resource,
        the response wraps the returned array of values in 

        a JSON object with paging metadata. For example:


        ```json

        {
            "startAt" : 0,
            "maxResults" : 10,
            "total": 200,
            "isLast": false,
            "values": [
                { /* result 0 */ },
                { /* result 1 */ },
                { /* result 2 */ }
            ]
        }

        ```


        *   `startAt` is the index of the first item returned in the page.

        *   `maxResults` is the maximum number of items that a page can return.
        Each operation can have a different limit for
            the number of items returned, and these limits may change without notice. To find the maximum number of items 
            that an operation could return, set `maxResults` to a large number—for example, over 1000—and if the returned value of `maxResults` is less than the requested value, the returned value is the maximum.
        *    `total` is the total number of items contained in all pages. This
        number **_may change_** as the client 

        requests the subsequent pages, therefore the client should always assume
        that the requested page can be empty. Note 

        that this property is not returned for all operations.

        *   `isLast` indicates whether the page returned is the last one. Note
        that this property is not returned for all operations.


        ### Ordering


        Some operations support ordering the elements of a response by a field.
        Check the documentation for the operation to 

        confirm whether ordering of a response is supported and which fields can
        be used. Responses are listed in ascending order 

        by default. You can change the order using the `orderby` query parameter
        with a `-` or `+` symbol. For example:


        *   `?orderBy=name` to order by `name` field ascending.

        *   `?orderBy=+name` to order by `name` field ascending.

        *   `?orderBy=-name` to order by `name` field descending.

    - anchor: timestamps
      body: >
        By default, top-level timestamps (e.g. updated and created) are returned
        in [ISO 8601](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) format, in the system
        default user time zone.


        To return date time data in the logged in user's timezone, please refer
        to `renderedFields` property under the `expand` query parameter in
        relevant APIs.
      title: Timestamps
    - anchor: special-request-headers
      body: >-
        The following request and response headers define important metadata for
        the Jira Cloud REST API resources.


        -   `X-Atlassian-Token` (request): Operations that accept
        multipart/form-data must include the `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check`

        header in requests. Otherwise the request is blocked by cross-site
        request forgery (CSRF/XSRF) protection.

        -   `X-Force-Accept-Language` (request): controls how the standard HTTP
        `Accept-Language` header is processed.

        By default `Accept-Language` is ignored and the response is in the
        language configured in the user's profile or,

        when no language is configured for the user, the default Jira instance
        language. For the response to recognize

        `Accept-Language` send `X-Force-Accept-Language = true` as well. If
        `Accept-Language` requests a language that Jira

        can return the response is in that language, otherwise Jira returns the
        response in the default language. If

        `Accept-Language` is not specified the response is in the default
        language.

        -   `X-AAccountId` (response): This response header contains the
        Atlassian account ID of the authenticated user.
      title: Special headers
    - anchor: anonymous-operations
      body: |2-
         Jira provides for all permissions, except the [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) Administer Jira, to be assigned to *Anyone*. Once a permission is assigned to *Anyone*, anyone knowing a project's URL is able to use the features in Jira enabled by the permission. However, the Jira REST API does not enable anonymous access for operations by default. This means that an anonymous user who may be able to perform an action through Jira, may not be able to perform the same action where it's enabled by the REST API. 

         The operations that provide anonymous access are annotated "This operation can be accessed anonymously."
      title: Anonymous operations
    - anchor: async-operations
      body: >-
        Some Jira REST API operations may trigger long-running or
        computationally expensive tasks. In these cases, the operation 

        will schedule an asynchronous task and return a `303 (See Other)`
        response, indicating the location of the queued task 

        in the `Location` header. You can query this task to get progress
        updates.


        When the task finishes, the response object will contain the `result`
        field. The content of the field is specific to the 

        operation that created the task. Refer to the operation’s documentation
        for more information.


        Note that asynchronous tasks are not guaranteed to be run in order. In
        other words, if you need your tasks to execute 

        in a certain order, you should start a task only after the prerequisite
        task(s) have finished.

    - anchor: status-codes
      body: >-
        The Jira Cloud platform REST API uses the [standard HTTP status
        codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).


        Operations that return an error status code may also return a response
        body containing details of the error or errors. 

        The schema for the response body is shown below:
